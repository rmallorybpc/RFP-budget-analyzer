## SCORING METHODOLOGY

**Overall Fit Score (0–100)**

| Dimension | Weight | What to assess |
|---|---|---|
| Technical Capability | 30% | Alignment between company capabilities and PWS technical requirements |
| Past Performance Relevance | 25% | Agency type, contract type, dollar value, and recency |
| Certifications & Socioeconomic | 20% | Set-aside eligibility and evaluation preference factors |
| Contract Vehicle Access | 15% | Competitive vehicle path and dispatch priority advantages |
| Team Capacity | 10% | Team size and key personnel against period of performance demands |

Scoring rules (required):
1. Score every dimension using requirement-to-capability delta analysis, not signal counting. Compare what the solicitation requires against what the company actually submitted in the profile inputs.
2. For Technical Capability, explicitly cross-reference RFP technical requirements, mandatory qualifications, certifications, key personnel qualifications, and staffing requirements against the company profile under ## Submitted Company Profile in the markdown document (and Input 2 when provided separately).
3. If the submitted profile shows shortfalls (for example fewer staff than required, missing certifications, or weak/no relevant past performance for required technical work), lower the score and flag the exact gap.
4. For each scored dimension, list the specific RFP requirements evaluated (with section references) and the corresponding company evidence used to assign the score.
5. Do not justify a score with phrasing such as "X positive signals" or "Y gap indicators" without showing the underlying requirement-to-submission comparison.

Thresholds: 75–100 Strong Pursue. 60–74 Conditional Pursue. 45–59 Selective Pursue. Below 45 Pass.

---

## BUDGET METHODOLOGY

1. Identify all labor categories explicitly or implicitly required by the PWS
2. Estimate level of effort per category per year based on PWS scope
3. Apply GSA rate midpoints from the reference table
4. Apply wrap rate of 1.35 if rates are base salary only
5. Calculate annual cost per category and total contract value across full period of performance
6. Flag categories where the company profile suggests a gap

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Produce the brief in the following exact markdown structure.
Write in second person addressing the company directly.
Use explicit subjects. No hyphens as sentence starters.
Professional tone suitable for direct client delivery.

### Budgeting Considerations

[Address each of the following in 1–2 sentences each:
- Primary cost drivers that will most affect the final price
- Indirect rate assumptions embedded in this estimate and where they may need adjustment
- Other direct costs beyond labor — travel, equipment, materials, subcontractor costs, consumables
- Fee strategy appropriate for this contract type and agency
- Price-to-win pressure based on evaluation criteria weighting and set-aside competition
- Labor escalation across option years and how to reflect it
- Any unusual payment terms, invoicing requirements, or withholding provisions from the solicitation]

> This budget estimate is based on GSA schedule rate midpoints and estimated level of effort derived from PWS analysis. Treat as a planning estimate. Actual proposal pricing requires detailed work breakdown structure analysis, site-specific overhead rates, and current GSA schedule verification.

---

## BD Risk Factors

[Provide evidence-backed BD risk bullets only. For each bullet include: risk statement, why it matters to bid/no-bid, and a mitigation action.]

[Only include risks that are specific to this solicitation. Every risk bullet must cite a specific RFP section/clause and explain why this language creates a meaningful pursuit risk for this opportunity in particular.]

[Exclude generic federal boilerplate from top BD issues. Do not elevate standard FAR/DFARS language that could appear in almost any RFP without modification, including routine format-compliance warnings, standard termination clauses, standard reps and certs language, and standard payment terms, unless the solicitation contains unusual deviations that create a specific risk.]

[If a candidate risk could be copied unchanged into most federal solicitations, do not include it as a top BD risk. Prioritize scope-specific constraints, unusual qualifications, distinctive evaluation language, timeline/compression risks, incumbent-advantage signals, or other competitive dynamics unique to this RFP.]

[Assess at minimum:]
- Unrealistic POP or transition timeline relative to scope complexity
- Vague or unstated evaluation criteria that reduce predictability
- Unusual intellectual property or data-rights clauses
- Overly restrictive qualifications limiting competition
- Short response timeline relative to proposal complexity
- Geographic/facility constraints limiting eligible offerors
- Price-evaluation methodology that may disadvantage higher-quality technical approaches

---

## Win Themes

[2–3 sentences on win theme strategy for this RFP. Provide three to five themes based on evaluator priorities and PWS emphasis.]

[Each theme must connect an agency pain point implied by the solicitation to a discriminating capability a strong offeror would demonstrate.]

[Explicitly identify solicitation hot-button issues such as prior performance failures, schedule pressure, transition risk, or specific technical pain points the agency calls out.]

**Theme 1: [Theme Title]**
Discriminator: [What makes this theme competitively distinctive — a strength the agency values that competitors cannot easily claim or replicate]
Proof Point: [Specific past performance, certification, or capability from the company profile that substantiates this theme with concrete evidence]
Placement: [Where in the proposal this theme should be most prominent — technical approach, management plan, executive summary, past performance, or all volumes]

**Theme 2: [Theme Title]**
Discriminator: [Discriminator]
Proof Point: [Proof point from company profile]
Placement: [Proposal placement]

**Theme 3: [Theme Title]**
Discriminator: [Discriminator]
Proof Point: [Proof point from company profile]
Placement: [Proposal placement]

**Theme Integration Note:**
[2 sentences on how to thread all themes consistently across proposal volumes rather than siloing them in the executive summary. Include one specific technique for maintaining theme continuity in a multi-author proposal.]

---

## Custom Past Performance Statements

[1–2 sentences on how past performance will be evaluated for this RFP, what the agency is looking for, and the recency and relevance standards implied by the solicitation.]

[For each relevant past performance example in the company's submitted profile, produce a tailored statement structured as follows:
- Contract name, agency, and contract number if available
- Dollar value and period of performance
- Technical work performed using language that mirrors this RFP's evaluation criteria
- Quantified outcomes wherever the submitted profile provides data
- Closing sentence connecting this experience to a specific requirement in the current RFP

If the company's past performance summary lacks sufficient detail for specific statements, produce a template with [BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS] and flag this explicitly in the Past Performance Quality Note below.]

**Past Performance Statement 1:**
[Draft statement or templated version with bracketed placeholders]

**Past Performance Statement 2:**
[Draft statement or templated version with bracketed placeholders]

**Past Performance Statement 3:**
[Draft statement or templated version — add additional statements if the profile warrants it]

**Past Performance Quality Note:**
[Honest assessment of whether the submitted past performance summary provides sufficient detail for a competitive past performance volume. If gaps exist, list specifically what additional information — contract numbers, dollar values, agency names, quantified outcomes, points of contact — the company should provide before the past performance volume is written.]

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Pursue Decision
[2 sentences with a clear pursue / conditional pursue / selective pursue / pass recommendation and the two most important factors driving it. Be direct.]

### Strengthen Before Submitting
[4–6 bulleted recommendations. Each must be specific and actionable. Reference the RFP requirement or evaluation criterion each recommendation addresses. Format: **Action** — explanation and connection to evaluation criteria or competitive positioning.]

### Teaming Considerations
[3–4 sentences. If gaps exist that subcontracting or teaming would address, identify the specific capability type needed, whether a prime or sub role is recommended, and what socioeconomic attributes a teaming partner should bring to strengthen competitive positioning or set-aside eligibility. If no teaming is needed, state that clearly and briefly.]

### Proposal Schedule
**RFP Due Date:** [Due date from solicitation]

| Milestone | Recommended Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Capture kick-off | [Date] | [Any prep required before this] |

**Schedule Risk:**
[1–2 sentences on any timeline risk given the RFP complexity, company team size, and time remaining before the due date. Flag if the timeline is tight and recommend what to descope or deprioritize if resources are constrained.]

### Compliance and Submission Red Flags
[3–5 bullets focused on proposal compliance failure points (portal constraints, file/volume formatting, late submission exposure, missing representations/certifications, page limit pressure) and specific mitigation actions.]
